# z-text-upfunker
> Funking up your texts by selecting html elements in your theme and assigning animation styles.

To funk up some headings on a website we made, we created a CSS-animation plugin (using a bit of JavaScript (no jQuery, weâ€™re keeping the funk pure)) with a bunch of funky effects.
Since we like them so much, we would like you to have it.
So here it is.


**Project page**

See https://plugins.zodan.nl/wp-text-upfunker/


## What does it do?

It lets you animate elements on your page by
* Selecting the elements using css selectors
* Selecting the desired animation style (or just randomly picked)
* Entering the maximum number of loops.


## What needs to be done?

* Add a meta box to the edit screen, so settings can be set per post/page/whatever
* Using data-* configuration for more details.
* Adding custom events (like onStart or onLoopComplete)
* Adding a custom capability to manage which users can change settings
* Adding more animation variations
